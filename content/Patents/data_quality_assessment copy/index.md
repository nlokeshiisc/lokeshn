abstract: Techniques for qualitatively assessing unlabeled data in an unsupervised machine learning environment are disclosed. In one example, a method comprises the following steps. A dataset of unlabeled data points is converted into a graph structure. Nodes of the graph structure represent the unlabeled data points in the dataset and weighted edges between at least a portion of the nodes represent similarity between the unlabeled data points represented by the nodes. A metric is computed for each node of the graph structure. A value generated by the metric for a given node represents a measure of dissimilarity between the corresponding unlabeled data point of the given node and one or more other unlabeled data points of one or more other nodes. A subset of the dataset is generated by removing one or more unlabeled data points from the dataset based on one or more values of the computed metric.
