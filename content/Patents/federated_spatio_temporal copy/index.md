abstract: Methods, systems, and computer program products for federated machine learning based on partially secured spatio-temporal data are provided herein. A computer-implemented method includes obtaining temporal data from a plurality of distributed client devices in conjunction with a federated machine learning process, wherein at least a portion of the data comprises encoded private data and at least a portion of the data is public data; generating a spatio-temporal graph comprising nodes representing the plurality of distributed client devices, wherein the generating comprises identifying at least one pair of similar nodes based at least in part on the public data and adding an edge to the spatio-temporal graph between the pair of similar nodes; and aligning encoders of at least two of the distributed client devices based on the spatio-temporal graph.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
