abstract: Methods, systems, and computer program products for automatically detecting outliers in federated data are provided herein. A computer-implemented method includes obtaining local outlier-related data from multiple client systems within a federated learning environment; detecting one or more federated learning environment-level outliers from at least a portion of the multiple client systems by processing at least a portion of the obtained local outlier-related data using one or more artificial intelligence models; determining at least one calibration parameter for detecting federated learning environment-level outliers based at least in part on the one or more detected federated learning environment-level outliers; and outputting the at least one determined calibration parameter to at least a portion of the multiple client systems within the federated learning environment.
