abstract: One embodiment provides a method , including  obtaining predictions generated by a deployed machine - learning model ; generating , from the obtained redictions , a validation dataset comprising a plurality of data points, wherein the validation dataset is generated in view of user prefer
ences related to desired performance metrics of the deployed machine - learning model ; ranking the plurality of data points of the validation dataset in view of the user preferences ; determining the deployed machine - learning model needs to be retrained by comparing the ranked plurality of data points to a training dataset used to train the deployed machine learning model and identifying , based upon the comparison, a quality of the deployed machine - learning model can be
increased above a predetermined threshold ; and retraining the deployed machine learning model utilizing a new train ing dataset being based upon the validation dataset and the ranked plurality of data points
