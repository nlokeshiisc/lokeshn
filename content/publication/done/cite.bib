abstract = {Attributed network embedding is the task to learn a lower dimensional vector representation
of the nodes of an attributed network, which can be used further for downstream network
mining tasks. Nodes in a network exhibit community structure and most of the network
embedding algorithms work well when the nodes, along with their attributes, adhere
to the community structure of the network. But real life networks come with community
outlier nodes, which deviate significantly in terms of their link structure or attribute
similarities from the other nodes of the community they belong to. These outlier nodes,
if not processed carefully, can even affect the embeddings of the other nodes in the
network. Thus, a node embedding framework for dealing with both the link structure
and attributes in the presence of outliers in an unsupervised setting is practically
important. In this work, we propose a deep unsupervised autoencoders based solution
which minimizes the effect of outlier nodes while generating the network embedding.
We use both stochastic gradient descent and closed form updates for faster optimization
of the network parameters. We further explore the role of adversarial learning for
this task, and propose a second unsupervised deep model which learns by discriminating
the structure and the attribute based embeddings of the network and minimizes the
effect of outliers in a coupled way. Our experiments show the merit of these deep
models to detect outliers and also the superiority of the generated network embeddings
for different downstream mining tasks. To the best of our knowledge, these are the
first unsupervised non linear approaches that reduce the effect of the outlier nodes
while generating Network Embedding.},
